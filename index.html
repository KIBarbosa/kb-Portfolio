  <summary>Personal Statement</summary>
  <p>In nature, the rain brings progress and new life. While rain gives plants the nourishment to grow
    deeper into the soil and sky it also provides seedlings with the chance to sprout. For me rain is
    refreshing and my favorite kind of weather. Light misty rain provides the best conditions for a
    relaxing neighborhood walk that I use for deep thinking. The cool air motivates me by providing
    fresh inspiration. <br> <br>
    One of my favorite metaphors about rain is “it is raining like cats and dogs out there”. When I
    hear this metaphor, I think of opportunity. All around us in the world are opportunities that are
    raining like cats and dogs. Opportunity is everywhere, we just need to grab a bucket and collect
    the rain. My optimism, adventurous spirit, and passion are my opportunity collection bucket.
    Large amounts of rain help improve the quality of the air around us by cleansing the air as it
    falls. Like the heavy rain, I strive to improve the quality of “air” around me through my ideas
    and innovative solutions. As the rain falls particles are captured and I can be collected in buckets
    of opportunity. Similarly, I take things from my environment and bring them to my opportunities
    to make the “air” around me better.<br><br>
    Puddles and rivers of opportunity from large rain collects into lakes and the vast ocean. My
    bucket of collected opportunity is smaller than a lake or an ocean but it can eventually grow and
    flow into greater opportunity. I can take my bucket of water to become greater through my hard
    work ethic. Everything is connected and I want to be a part of a larger body of water of collected
    opportunity that is bigger than myself.

  <summary>Innovation Development Essay</summary>
  <p><i style="font-weight: normal;">
    "The vitality of thought is in adventure. Ideas won’t keep. Something must be done with
    them.”
    </i><br>  -- Alfred North Whitehead, 1861-1947. From the series of Great Ideas</p>
    <br>
    <p>If an idea can be used to create good in the world, then as Alfred Whitehead says,
        “something must be done with them”. As an innovator, I believe that the good impact of ideas
        will fade into the fabric of the universe unless they are implemented into action to create impact.
        Action, in my confidence, can only be accomplished by a human being. However, in the age of
        technology, it is a misconception that all the ideas in the world have already been thought of as
        information is only a few clicks away. There is also a misconception that there is no need to
        come up with new ideas because artificial intelligence can “make” ideas for us.
        <br><br>Looking to the future, I am concerned that impactful ideas are dwindling as we rely upon
        technology. Our reliance on technology, I fear, stops us from thinking for ourselves. It is
        becoming easier for us to use the ideas and the step-by-step tutorials from the internet and label
        them as innovation. We find it commonplace in our world today to use the information on the
        internet we are exposed to as a replacement for incubating new ideas. Nevertheless, I have a
        vision for a future that despite our reliance on technology, we can still benefit from the good that
        comes from implementing ideas that can only be created by the human mind. My vision includes
        the good we bring to the world through using ideas we come up with to solve complex problems,
        improve our quality of life, and advance our society.
        <br><br>We all know that not every problem we are up against fits into a cookie cutter or a
        predesigned mold. Many of the biggest problems we face are unique in nature with differing
        nuances to navigate. If we rely on using technology alone, we can only present a problem with
        solutions that already exist. However, the human brain can craft solutions with a thinking process
        that can only come from life experiences, which cannot be replicated by a machine. Therefore, I
        still envision a future where human problem-solving skills are still relevant. I also perceive the
        future where we use technology as a tool to get started in our own innovation when it is applicable. 
        Not all of technology is bad, but I think we will need to reach a point where we know
        when to turn away from technology and use our brains.
        <br><br>Since computers cannot see what is good or what can be improved in life, I can see a
        future where our most impactful innovations are based on human intuition. We are unreplaceable
        in the regard that only we can see from a human perspective. Our perspective gives us an
        advantage to amplify the good that is already in existence and improve upon it. A computer will
        only “see” the limited perspective of the human condition provided to its database. There is an
        inherent limit on the amount of learning a machine can experience because it does not experience
        life. Thus, a machine cannot comprehend all the details that a person can intuitively see and act
        upon. My vision includes using human intuition to understand where our weaknesses lie and
        improve our daily lives as a result.
        <br><br>Lastly, I envision human-generated ideas in practice being put to work towards advancing
        society. I feel strongly that we can use the human capabilities of compassion and
        conscientiousness to break out of the box and enhance society as an entirety. Society has vastly
        more connections than any technological system in existence, making it intricate and complex. In
        perspective, it takes large groups of people to make impactful changes to society. Therefore,
        innovation on the level of advancing society is far too complex to be simulated by a machine or
        generated with a list of to-dos. It is crucial that for us to progress as a society we must create our
        own ideas and work together, and I have a vision that we will.
        <br><br>The bottom line is that innovation does not have an impact if we are consulting
        technology for every idea we have. Nonetheless, technology does have its place in helping
        provide us with resources to start or further our ideas. I ultimately believe we must be the ones to
        decide which ideas are created to make the greatest and most positive impact possible. We cannot
        expect there to be progress in innovation without putting forth effort into our ideas because in
        innovation there are no shortcuts or substitutes for the human mind. As a result, if we seek true
        innovation then we must never forget to think for ourselves to bring our ideas into impact and
        that is my vision for the future.
